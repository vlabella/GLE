#
# -- create a release - run manually to create a release
#
#    - checks out gle source code
#    - gets version number from CMakeLists.txt file
#    - creates tag and release using version number
#    - gets changes from docs/ChangeLog.tct
#         all lines from version number to first blank line
#    - when complete it triggers build and package workflows for all three OSes.
#    - need to upload artefacts from the build process to the release manually for now
